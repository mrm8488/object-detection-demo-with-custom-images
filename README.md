# Object Detection Demo with custom images
This repo is a modified version of the object detection kernel provided by Google in order to **allow you to detect objects from an image given its URL**. The normal version only allows you to use images in your fileystem.

## Steps to work with this kernel:

1) Clone this repository: https://github.com/tensorflow/models
2) Once it is cloned, go to **research** > **object_detection**
3) Follow the installation steps: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md
4) Copy the kernel from this repository (*object_detection_custom_images.ipynb*) to the folder **object_detection**
5) Launch Jupyter and play with this kernel
